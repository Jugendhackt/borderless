borderless
==========

BorderLess is a project that aims to establish a rating platform for locations
concerning their suitability for disabled people. Especially the smartphone
app enables to vote the location in the moment you notice something not very
disabled-friendly.

Therefore we invented a new rating system that differs between several degrees
and kinds of disability. Moreover you can leave comments to describe your
matter in more detail. For every rate you post you get credit points that you
can swap into a discount at the participating and sponsoring companies.

BorderLess considers the different degrees of disability if a group would like
to visit a sight and list several suitable opportunities for the visit. In the
future we will implement a route planner that considers the daily plan of the
user and detects the shortest and friendliest route for the day because we
believe that the project is a very helpful tool.
